# Q.2 Create an Account class Heirarchy 
# Account with super class (acc_id, name, balance)
# methods - withdraw and deposit

# Create SavingsAccount as sub class of account - additional field (type - personal/corporate etc)
# implement withdraw and deposit such that
# - maximum upto 1 lakh can be deposited in an account at a time
# - Min balance 5000 must be maintained while withdrawal (if type = corporate you withdraw full amount = balance)

# Create CurrentAccount as sub class of account
# implement withdraw and deposit such that
# - maximum upto 2 lakh can be deposited in an account at a time
# - Min balance 10000 must be maintained while withdrawal

# Create Bank App with Transaction class
# Create Method withdraw_from_account(account : Account)  and deposit_to_account(account : Account)
# These methods will return the new balance after deposite/withdraw

# Creare user class with user interface that gives 2 menu options
# 1. Deposit
# 2. Withdraw

# Both options will ask user to enter money to withdraw/deposite
# Display a statement with each transaction and final balance after user exits from the menu
